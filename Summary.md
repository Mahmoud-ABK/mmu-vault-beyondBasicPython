# Beyond Basics Python 

Welcome to the "Beyond Basics Python" vault! This vault is designed to help you explore advanced Python topics and deepen your understanding of the language. 

>***Note**: This vault assumes you have a solid understanding of basic Python concepts such as variables, loops, and functions. If you’re new to Python, it’s recommended to start with beginner-level resources before diving into this content.*

Here, you will find a collection of notes and resources on topics such as:
## Topics Covered:

- **[[Python Virtual environments and Anaconda]]** : Learn how to create and manage virtual environments in Python using `venv` and Anaconda.
  Learn how to install , set up and manage the popular IDE **`jupyter lab`** 
  **Relevance**:
	- **Software Development**: Essential for managing dependencies across multiple projects.
	- **Data Science**: Helps isolate project environments for consistency across different tools and libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, pandas).
	- **Machine Learning**: Ensures reproducibility by managing environment-specific libraries for model training.

- **[[Plotting in Python]]** : Master the essentials of Python plotting—including syntax, basic plotting patterns, and reasoning—so you can create effective visualizations without relying on external tools.
  **Relevance**:
	- **Data Science**: Core for visualizing data distributions, trends, and patterns using libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.
	- **Machine Learning**: Vital for plotting model performance and diagnostics (e.g., ROC curves, loss functions).
	- **Web Development**: Plotting is essential for creating interactive visualizations in web apps (using Dash or Flask).
